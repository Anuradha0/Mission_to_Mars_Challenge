# Mission-to-Mars
 
## Overview of Project

During the tenth week of the Trilogy University of Toronto Data Analytics & Visualization Bootcamp our Module 8 challenge is to create a written analysis with three key deliverables as follows; 

Here is the list of deliverables for the analysis of 4 deliverables:

- Deliverable 1: Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
- Deliverable 2: Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
- Deliverable 3: Add Bootstrap 3 Components

The tools we will be using are Splinter to automate a web browser, BeautifulSoup to parse and extract the data, and MongoDB to hold the data that has been gathered. Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLLite, SQLALchemy to filter, and Flask, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code while posting to GitHub repository for the team to review work if required.

Specifically, Robin's web app is looking good and functioning well, but she wants to add more polish to it. She had been admiring images of Mars’s hemispheres online and realized that the site is scraping-friendly. She would like to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. To do this, you’ll use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.

The files we will be using are :

- Mission_to_Mars.ipynb as Mission_to_Mars_Challenge.ipynb with Mission_to_Mars_starter_code.ipynb to Scrape High-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles.
- Modifying the Scraping.py, app.py, and index.html which is locating in the template folder to Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles.
- Add Bootstrp 3 Compenents 

## Results

The components of the deliverables are as follows;

 1. Adding the hemisphere images as thumbnails, like the image below.

 2. Styling the "Scrape New Data" button image and completing the 


 3. Styling the "Scrape New Data" button using headings that can be edited by size , font, color. 
Typography in All HTML headings, (h1-through-h6), are available. .h1 through .h6 classes are also available, for when you want to match the font styling of a heading but still want your text to be displayed inline.

Or using a single set of .col-md-* grid classes, you can create a basic grid system that starts out stacked on mobile devices and tablet devices (the extra small to small range) before becoming horizontal on desktop (medium) devices, whereby you place grid columns in any .row.


## Summary of Challenge & Module 

We wrote and tested the functions in juypter notebook and exported to python and used virtual studio to complete the following:
-<h5>Jupyter vs. Python script for MarsFacts Tables and Table Formatting
